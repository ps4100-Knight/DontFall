# DontFall
Explore a dungeon and try not to fall into a dark abyss.

Dont fall is a project made with C++ to show how efficent code can make level design so much easier. 
With one single class of platforms a designer can create six differnt types of platforms that behave differntly based on the variables they set as needed.
The theme was insprited by the lord of the ring's mountain mines which are built like a medival castle but there's always a chance of falling deep into a dark abyss.
